## Introduction

## Predicting Employee Attrition and Retention

* Employee data provided by Frito Lay's Human Resources can reveal trends driving attrition
* Exploratory data analysis provides a high-level view of attrition and retention
* Classification models can help predict employee attrition

### The Goal

* Identify the causes of attrition
* Empower leaders to build and maintain strong teams

## Why is attrition important?

* Employees are an investment
* Employee turnover is costly
  * [Applauz](https://www.applauz.me/resources/costs-of-employee-turnover) estimates that "The costs of replacing an individual worker can range from half to four times the employeeâ€™s annual salary."
* Retention gives businesses a competitive advantage
  * According to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/employee-retention/), "Improving employee retention rates can lower costs, increase worker productivity, and ultimately boost revenues and profits."

## Overview of Employee Dataset

* Data provided for 870 employees, 16% of whom are positive for attrition
* 36 features covering a variety of characteristics
* Includes both objective information (age, pay, experience) and self-reported impressions of employee engagement and job satisfaction
* No missing data

## Highlight 1: Job Role

|               | P-Value from Chi-Square Test |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| JobRole       | <.0001                       |
| Department    | 0.0094                       |

## Highlight 2: Overtime

| MaritalStatus | <.0001                       |

## Correlation With Attrition

#### Positive Correlation (increases chance of attrition)

| Variable                   | Correlation |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Distance from Home         | 0.0871363   |
| Number of Companies Worked | 0.0610189   |
| Hourly Rate                | 0.0365542   |
| Performance Rating         | 0.0153338   |

---

#### Negative Correlation (decreases chance of attrition)

| Variable                   | Correlation |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Job Involvement            | -0.187793   |
| Total Working Years        | -0.167206   |
| Job Level                  | -0.162136   |
| Years in Current Role      | -0.156216   |
| Monthly Income             | -0.154915   |
| Age                        | -0.149384   |
| Stock Option Level         | -0.14868    |
| Years with Current Manager | -0.146782   |
| Years at Company           | -0.128754   |
| Job Satisfaction           | -0.107521   |

#### These relationships aren't strong individually, but together they can help build a predictive model

## Predictive Model (Naive Bayes)

* Uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of attrition by combining the individual probabilities of different factors
* Recursive feature elimination to select most predictive features
* Lasso regression to discover impactful feature interactions
* Probability of target class can be adjusted to favor sensitivity or specificity

## Recursive Feature Elimination

* Iterates through the feature set, eliminating least important feature on each pass
* Confirmed results from chi-square tests and correlation matrices
* Reported "diminishing returns" beyond 25 features (final model includes 23)

## Lasso Regression

* Reduces large coefficients in linear model to prevent overfitting
  * Useful for unbalanced datasets
* Helps find the most impactful features and interactions
* Introduces data from the EducationField, EnvironmentSatisfaction, and WorkLifeBalance features
  * EnvironmentSatisfaction and WorkLifeBalance interaction brings self-reported data into the model

| Feature Interactions             |
| -------------------------------- |
| EducationField and JobRole       |
| BusinessTravel and JobRole       |
| MaritalStatus and OverTime       |
| Gender and OverTime              |
| JobRole and OverTime             |
| EducationField and MaritalStatus |
| EnvironmentSatisfaction and WorkLifeBalance |

## Balancing Data and Tuning Probability Threshold

### Data Balancing

* Only 16% of the dataset positive for attrition, which biases the non-attrition class
* Random downsampling created a 2-to-1 ratio of non-attrition to attrition
* Improves sensitivity and specificity

### Probability Threshold

* This model struggled with false positives
* Increasing the attrition probability threshold to 63% makes it more precise
* Can be tuned further for cost-benefit analysis

## Predictive Model Performance

* Ran 10000 random seeds to test mean of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
* 76.15% accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions)
* 81.38% sensitivity (positively identifying attrition)
* 65.83% specificity (avoiding false positives)
* 81.81% F1 score (combined measurement of precision and sensitivity)

## Next Steps

* Analyze results of model against comparison dataset
* Communicate results of EDA and modeling to management team
  * Support their efforts to retain top talent
* Further refine model to fit Frito Lay's needs
  * Cost benefit analysis for attrition and retention
