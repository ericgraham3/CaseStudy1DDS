## Predicting Employee Attrition and Retention

* Employee data provided by Frito Lay's Human Resources can reveal trends driving attrition
* Exploratory data analysis provides a high-level view of attrition and retention
* Classification models can help predict employee attrition
* Identifying the causes of attrition empowers leaders to build and maintain strong teams

## Why is attrition important?

* Employees are an investment
* Employee turnover is costly
  * [Applauz](https://www.applauz.me/resources/costs-of-employee-turnover) estimates that "The costs of replacing an individual worker can range from half to four times the employeeâ€™s annual salary."
* Retention gives businesses a competetive advantage
  * According to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/employee-retention/), "Improving employee retention rates can lower costs, increase worker productivity, and ultimately boost revenues and profits."

## Overview of Employee Dataset

* Data provided for 870 employees, 730 of whom are still with the company
* 36 columns covering a variety of characteristics
* Includes both objective information (age, pay, experience) and self-reported impressions of employee engagement and job satisfaction
* No missing data

## Highlight 1: Job Role

## Correlation With Attrition

#### Positive Correlation (increases chance of attrition)

| Variable                   | Correlation |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Distance from Home         | 0.0871363   |
| Number of Companies Worked | 0.0610189   |
| Hourly Rate                | 0.0365542   |
| Performance Rating         | 0.0153338   |

---

#### Negative Correlation (decreases chance of attrition)

| Variable                   | Correlation |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Job Involvement            | -0.187793   |
| Total Working Years        | -0.167206   |
| Job Level                  | -0.162136   |
| Years in Current Role      | -0.156216   |
| Monthly Income             | -0.154915   |
| Age                        | -0.149384   |
| Stock Option Level         | -0.14868    |
| Years with Current Manager | -0.146782   |
| Years at Company           | -0.128754   |
| Job Satisfaction           | -0.107521   |

#### These relationships aren't strong individually, but together they can help build a predictive model

## Predictive Model 1: Naive Bayes

* Initial modeling used all variables
* 85.5% accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions)
* 90.3% sensitivity (positively identifying attrition)
* 60.4% specificity (avoiding false positives)

## Predicitve Model 2: K Nearest Neighbors

* Initial modeling used selected variables
* 74.9% accuracy (proportion of all correct predictions)
* 85.6% sensitivity (positively identifying attrition)
* 19.6% specificity (avoiding false positives)

## Next Steps for Predictive Model

* Analyze results of recursive feature elimination to identify key variables
* Feature selection: feeding the model the right amount of variables
* Feature engineering: optimizing variables to enhance model performance

## Conclusion

* Identify further areas of interest from full EDA
* Finalize predictive models
