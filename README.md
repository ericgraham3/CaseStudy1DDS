# Case Study 1
### DD6306 (Doing Data Science)
### Southern Methodist University
### Fall 2024

This is a class project for which we were asked to predict employee attrition
using either Naive Bayes or KNN. 

The case_study_final R-markdown file is the finished product, including the EDA
and the model. The other RMD files are either the EDA-only or specifically for 
my presentation.
